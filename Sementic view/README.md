# Semantic view — short

A semantic view is a read-only SQL view that exposes business-friendly column names, computed metrics, and stable types for analytics.

How to build (3 steps)
1. Select base table(s) or view(s).  
2. Rename and CAST columns to stable, documented types.  
3. Add computed measures/metrics and limit exposed columns.
